## Introduction

This project is a Todo application designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It provides a clean and intuitive user interface, allowing users to add, update, and delete tasks.

## Features

### 1. Add New Tasks

Users can add new tasks to the Todo list by providing a title for each task. The application generates a unique identifier for each task and includes a timestamp for when the task was created.

### 2. Update Tasks

Existing tasks can be updated, allowing users to modify the title or status of a task. This feature is useful for refining task details without having to delete and recreate tasks.

### 3. Mark Tasks as Complete or Incomplete

Tasks can be marked as complete or incomplete. This status helps users keep track of their progress and identify which tasks still require attention.

### 4. Delete Tasks

Users can easily remove tasks from the Todo list when they are no longer needed. Deleting tasks helps in maintaining a clean and organized task list.

### 5. Filter Tasks

The application provides a filter option that allows users to view tasks based on their completion status. Users can choose to display all tasks, only incomplete tasks, or only completed tasks.
